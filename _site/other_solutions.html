<h2 id="foss">FOSS</h2>

<p>One of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">Open-Source Software’s</a> core aims is to <strong>shed light</strong> on the <strong>inner-workings</strong> of the programs we use. Whilst very noble, and having many <strong>other</strong> benefits, it <strong>fails</strong> to properly protect against the set of <a href="./risks">risks we have outlined</a>.</p>

<p>As a <strong>simple</strong> example, an open-source <strong>social</strong> network will store data in a <strong>database</strong>, which will then be <strong>read</strong> and utilized by the providers of the social network in <strong>any</strong> way they see fit, leaving end-users on <strong>square-one</strong>.</p>

<p>This raises the <strong>larger</strong> problem of <strong>verifiability</strong>, that being open-source <strong>isn’t</strong> a guarantee that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No <strong>other</strong> software is running in the <strong>system</strong> - for example, a <strong>data-analytics</strong> engine</li>
  <li>The software <strong>advertised</strong> to run on the system is <strong>actually</strong> running on it - for example, a private messenger that has a <strong>back-door</strong> through an injected <strong>ad-tech</strong> snippet.</li>
</ul>

<p>While open-source has <strong>numerous</strong> benefits, and is a very <strong>positive</strong> signal of trust-making, on its own it <strong>cannot</strong> ensure proper governance.</p>

<h2 id="dlt">DLT</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger">Distributed Ledger Technology</a> (DLT) <strong>promises</strong> to solve the issue of <strong>verifiability</strong> through the usage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract">smart contracts</a>. A smart contract is software that runs <strong>verifiably</strong>, and is also often verifiably <strong>open-sourced</strong> - ensuring that what you <strong>see</strong> is what you <strong>get</strong>.</p>

<p>Smart <strong>contracts</strong> running on a DLT are, by <strong>nature</strong>, fully transparent in both <strong>operation</strong> and data <strong>governance</strong>. They also prevent the kind of <strong>centralized</strong> analytics and data collection that plagues <strong>traditional</strong> software apps and platforms.</p>

<p><strong>Unfortunately</strong>, the technology hasn’t evolved enough to run with the <strong>efficiency</strong> we expect of traditional software, and may not <strong>ever</strong> get close-enough to it due to <strong>fundamental</strong> computational penalties it incurs to <strong>maintain</strong> the abovementioned <strong>properties</strong>.</p>

<p>It does <strong>not</strong> mean we will not see a <strong>shift</strong> towards DLT technology in the near future, but it most <strong>likely</strong> means that we will <strong>still rely</strong> on traditional software for <strong>many</strong> common uses, for many <strong>years</strong> to come.</p>

<p>This <strong>also</strong> means that we need something to <strong>protect</strong> end-user safety in the <strong>current</strong> systems we use, while more <strong>human-centered</strong> technology is being perfected.</p>

<h2 id="b-corp">B-CORP</h2>

<p>A <a href="https://bcorporation.net/">B-Corporation</a> is a <strong>certification</strong> that businesses, including <strong>software</strong> providers, can apply to, and <strong>maintain</strong>, paying a yearly fee to the accreditor.</p>

<p>The <strong>aims</strong> of the B-Corporation accredetation are to <strong>increase</strong> and celebrate accountability, <strong>transparency</strong>, social-responsibility and <strong>ethical</strong> nature of for-profit businesses.</p>

<p>In <strong>principle</strong>, software maintained by a certified <strong>B-Corporation</strong> should greatly <strong>mitigate</strong> the risks to end-users we have outlined. <strong>However</strong>, the certification does not specifically <strong>address</strong> these risks, providing <strong>leeway</strong> for companies to engage in <strong>practices</strong> that result in these risks materializing.</p>

<p><strong>Furthermore</strong>, a B-Corp accredetation is legally <strong>non-binding</strong> with regards to the <strong>actions</strong> a software provider may take, which offers no <strong>legal</strong> protection for the end-user, both <strong>during</strong> the accredetation, nor if it is <strong>revoked</strong>.</p>
