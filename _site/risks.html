      <h1 id="risks-to-end-users">Risks to End-Users</h1>

<p>Below is a <strong>non-exhaustive</strong> list of risks all software users are <strong>exposed</strong> to.</p>

<h2 id="hidden-patterns">Hidden Patterns</h2>

<p>Derivative, or <strong>aggregate</strong>, data is the initially-hidden information the software provider can <strong>derive</strong> from how its users <strong>interact</strong> with the software. This data, nearly always, is the <strong>sole property</strong> of the software provider. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Users’ <strong>friends</strong>, and friends-of-friends</li>
  <li>Hidden <strong>demographic</strong> characteristics, such as <strong>socio-economic</strong> standing</li>
  <li>Favourite places to <strong>shop</strong> or <strong>be</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Political</strong> bias</li>
  <li><strong>Sexual</strong> preference</li>
  <li><strong>Psychological</strong> profile</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, this data can be used to intensifying <strong>opinion bubbles</strong>, and applying <strong>psychological techniques</strong> according to the users’ profile - by algorithmically encouraging <strong>“doomscrolling”</strong> or by taking advantage of other psychological <strong>vulnerabilities</strong> to keep users engaged.</p>

<p>These outcomes usually happen <strong>inadvertently</strong>, when <strong>time on the platform</strong> is optimized using <strong>machine learning</strong> techniques. Another <strong>common</strong> use of derivative data, is its <strong>sale</strong> to third-parties in anonymized or aggregate form, which is seldom disclosed to users. Anonymized data is also open to <strong>de-anonymizing</strong> techniques by cross-referencing <strong>multiple</strong> data-sets.</p>

<h2 id="future-analytics">Future Analytics</h2>

<p>A <strong>related</strong> risk to derivative data is <strong>future</strong> derivative data. Since disk <strong>storage is cheap</strong>, both raw and aggregate data are often stored for an <strong>indefinite</strong> period of time.</p>

<p>This means the owners of this data are <strong>free to run</strong> improved analytics at any point in the future, as both <strong>AI</strong> and <strong>computing power</strong> become more <strong>powerful</strong>, and monetize, or otherwise utilize users’ data <strong>many</strong> times over, without users’ knowledge or consent.</p>

<p>Importantly, this means users are <strong>exposed</strong> to unknown risks, especially in case the <strong>political</strong> climate changes, leaving users <strong>bare</strong> to future <strong>scrutiny</strong> by yet-unknown actors.</p>

<h2 id="addictive-by-design">Addictive By Design</h2>

<p>In a <strong>landscape</strong> with multiple <strong>competitive</strong> software platforms, and real-world <strong>demands</strong>, an increasing percentage of for-profit software is consciously making their products psychologically <strong>addictive</strong>.</p>

<p>This is done <strong>without</strong> consideration for the <strong>well-being</strong> of its end-users, and for the <strong>sole purpose</strong> of keeping users engaged as much as possible, directly <strong>paying</strong> for items, being exposed to <strong>advertisements</strong>, or otherwise performing actions <strong>beneficial</strong> to the software provider.</p>

<p>This <strong>environment</strong> has kicked-off a technological arms-race to the <strong>bottom</strong> of the <strong>brain-stem</strong>, where software apps and services <strong>compete</strong> against each other for <strong>user-attention</strong> by appealing to increasingly basic <strong>neurological</strong> and physiological responses.</p>

<h2 id="opaque-data-governance">Opaque Data-Governance</h2>

<p>Unless the software falls within a <strong>well-regulated</strong> domain (such as medical, insurance and financial,) there are very <strong>little assurances</strong> end-users get about how <strong>their data</strong> is managed.</p>

<p><strong>Encrypting</strong>, and otherwise securing, <strong>information</strong> and communications users percieve as <strong>private</strong> is purely <strong>voluntary</strong> (depending on the jurisdiction,) and very often <strong>lacking</strong>. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Private</strong> messages</li>
  <li><strong>Email</strong> addresses</li>
  <li><strong>Physical</strong> addresses</li>
  <li><strong>Phone</strong> numbers</li>
  <li>Even <strong>passwords</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This can, and does, lead to <strong>information breaches</strong>, both internal (e.g. <strong>employees</strong> gaining access to private messages), and external (presenting an <strong>easy target</strong> for hackers.)</p>

<h2 id="user-data-ownership">User-Data Ownership</h2>

<p>Often, the software platform will <strong>claim</strong> ownership to users’ <strong>original content</strong>, be it <strong>photos</strong>, written pieces, etc. This can take <strong>several forms</strong> from a very permissive license to full-ownership, but in the bottom line, it can <strong>limit</strong> users from cross-publishing their content elsewhere, <strong>monetizing</strong> it on another platform, or using it in other ways the software platform otherwise does not approve of. It also <strong>opens the door</strong> for the software platform to <strong>use</strong> the content in ways the users <strong>did not</strong> intend.</p>
