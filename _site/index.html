      <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<h2 id="in-a-nutshell">In a Nutshell</h2>

<p><strong>HEULAS</strong> is an a-la-carte set of <strong>legally binding</strong> amendments to both new and <strong>existing</strong> software <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-user_license_agreement">End-User License Agreements</a> (<strong>EULA</strong>). It was conceived to <strong>educate</strong> about current risks, provide a <strong>framework</strong> for safeguarding users’ best interests, and an <strong>incentive</strong> for software providers to do so.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>Traditionally, EULAs are crafted to <strong>shield</strong> the software <strong>provider</strong> from legal liability. This leads to a de-facto <strong>lack of accountability</strong> of software providers <strong>towards</strong> the end-users, especially when the services they provide are <strong>free</strong>, or sold at a very low price. Very few software providers incorporate <strong>user rights</strong> into their offerings - and when they do, it is often <strong>non-binding</strong>.</p>

<p>This situation <strong>exposes</strong> billions of software users to <strong>present</strong> and <strong>future</strong> risks that are not always <strong>obvious</strong> nor <strong>intuitive</strong>, but can have profound negative <strong>impact</strong> on people’s lives. These risks and their impact <strong>grow</strong> as we become more <strong>dependent</strong> on, and integrated with, <strong>technology</strong>.</p>

<p>From this background, a <strong>need</strong> arises to reshape the narrative of software into a more <strong>ethical</strong>, <strong>safer</strong> and, ultimately, <strong>kinder</strong> direction.</p>

<h3 id="read-more-about-the-risks-to-end-users"><a href="./risks">Read more about the risks to end-users</a></h3>

<h2 id="a-solution">A Solution</h2>

<p>HEULAS aims to tackle the problem and its risks with a two-pronged approach:</p>

<h3 id="end-user-protection">End-User Protection</h3>

<p>HEULAS will <strong>offer</strong> a growing and <strong>evolving</strong> set of EULA amendments, some of which <strong>refer</strong> to, and <strong>build</strong> on one another. When a software-provider <strong>incorporates</strong> one or more amendment, they will be <strong>bound</strong> by the protection it offers the end-users.</p>

<h3 id="recognition-of-ethics">Recognition of Ethics</h3>

<p>HEULAS will offer <strong>online badges</strong> for the software providers that <strong>reflect</strong> which amendments the provider has chosen to <strong>accept</strong>. In addition, these software providers will be <strong>featured</strong> and promoted on a “wall of fame”, an indexed directory and other places.</p>

<h3 id="other-solutions">Other Solutions</h3>

<p>This <strong>problem</strong> is being directly and indirectly <strong>tackeled</strong> from different angles by <strong>various</strong> approaches and organizations and, while offering multiple <strong>benefits</strong> on their own, they either <strong>fall short</strong> from mitigating risk to end-users, or else they <strong>do not</strong> apply to the wide <strong>variety</strong> of software being used in the wild.</p>
