# Other Solutions

## FOSS

One of [Open-Source Software's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) core aims is to __shed light__ on the __inner-workings__ of the programs we use. Whilst very noble, and having many __other__ benefits, it __fails__ to properly protect against the set of [risks we have outlined](./risks).

As a __simple__ example, an open-source __social__ network will store data in a __database__, which will then be __read__ and utilized by the providers of the social network in __any__ way they see fit, leaving end-users on __square-one__.

This raises the __larger__ problem of __verifiability__, that being open-source __isn't__ a guarantee that:

* No __other__ software is running in the __system__ - for example, a __data-analytics__ engine
* The software __advertised__ to run on the system is __actually__ running on it - for example, a private messenger that has a __back-door__ through an injected __ad-tech__ snippet.

While open-source has __numerous__ benefits, and is a very __positive__ signal of trust-making, on its own it __cannot__ ensure proper governance. 

## DLT

[Distributed Ledger Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger) (DLT) __promises__ to solve the issue of __verifiability__ through the usage of [smart contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract). A smart contract is software that runs __verifiably__, and is also often verifiably __open-sourced__ - ensuring that what you __see__ is what you __get__.

Smart __contracts__ running on a DLT are, by __nature__, fully transparent in both __operation__ and data __governance__. They also prevent the kind of __centralized__ analytics and data collection that plagues __traditional__ software apps and platforms.

__Unfortunately__, the technology hasn't evolved enough to run with the __efficiency__ we expect of traditional software, and may not __ever__ get close-enough to it due to __fundamental__ computational penalties it incurs to __maintain__ the abovementioned __properties__.

It does __not__ mean we will not see a __shift__ towards DLT technology in the near future, but it most __likely__ means that we will __still rely__ on traditional software for __many__ common uses, for many __years__ to come. 

This __also__ means that we need something to __protect__ end-user safety in the __current__ systems we use, while more __human-centered__ technology is being perfected.

## B-CORP

A [B-Corporation](https://bcorporation.net/) is a __certification__ that businesses, including __software__ providers, can apply to, and __maintain__, paying a yearly fee to the accreditor.

The __aims__ of the B-Corporation accredetation are to __increase__ and celebrate accountability, __transparency__, social-responsibility and __ethical__ nature of for-profit businesses. 

In __principle__, software maintained by a certified __B-Corporation__ should greatly __mitigate__ the risks to end-users we have outlined. __However__, the certification does not specifically __address__ these risks, providing __leeway__ for companies to engage in __practices__ that result in these risks materializing.

__Furthermore__, a B-Corp accredetation is legally __non-binding__ with regards to the __actions__ a software provider may take, which offers no __legal__ protection for the end-user, both __during__ the accredetation, nor if it is __revoked__.

## CHT

The [Center for Humane Technology](https://www.humanetech.com/) (CHT) was born out of a __frustration__ with current technology __trends__, and aims to both explore the __psychological__ risks in continuing down the path we're on, as well as explore and __promote__ a healthy path __forward__.

The Center for __Humane__ Technology conducts and __promotes__ research, education, policy and software __initiatives__. These address __many__ of the risks we have identified (and others we have not,) __however__ the CHT does not offer a solid __framework__ to protect end-users, and only provides __advice__ on how to voluntarily mitigate the risks.
