# Introduction

## In a Nutshell

__HEULAS__ is an a-la-carte set of __legally binding__ amendments to both new and __existing__ software [End-User License Agreements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-user_license_agreement) (__EULA__). It was conceived to __educate__ about current risks, provide a __framework__ for safeguarding users' best interests, and an __incentive__ for software providers to do so.

## The Problem

Traditionally, EULAs are crafted to __shield__ the software __provider__ from legal liability. This leads to a de-facto __lack of accountability__ of software providers __towards__ the end-users, especially when the services they provide are __free__, or sold at a very low price. Very few software providers incorporate __user rights__ into their offerings - and when they do, it is often __non-binding__.

This situation __exposes__ billions of software users to __present__ and __future__ risks that are not always __obvious__ nor __intuitive__, but can have profound negative __impact__ on people's lives. These risks and their impact __grow__ as we become more __dependent__ on, and integrated with, __technology__.

From this background, a __need__ arises to reshape the narrative of software into a more __ethical__, __safer__ and, ultimately, __kinder__ direction.

## A Solution

HEULAS aims to tackle the problem and its risks with a two-pronged approach:

### End-User Protection

HEULAS will __offer__ a growing and __evolving__ set of EULA amendments, some of which __refer__ to, and __build__ on one another. When a software-provider __incorporates__ one or more amendment, they will be __bound__ by the protection it offers the end-users.

### Recognition of Ethics

HEULAS will offer __online badges__ for the software providers that __reflect__ which amendments the provider has chosen to __accept__. In addition, these software providers will be __featured__ and promoted on a "wall of fame", an indexed directory and other places.

### Other Solutions

This __problem__ is being directly and indirectly __tackeled__ from different angles by __various__ approaches and organizations. They offering multiple __benefits__ on their own, however each solution individually either __falls short__ from truly mitigating risk to end-users, or else __does not__ apply to the wide __variety__ of software being used in the wild. HEULAS provides a __framework__ that is easy to __integrate__ with each such approach and organization, __combining__ efforts to transition towards, __celebrate__ and maintain ethical software.

## A Distributed Effort

HEULAS aims to be a truly __distributed__, and people-driven __non-organization__. Suggestions, discussion, and new content is __encouraged__ via the public [GitHub repo]({{ site.github.repository_url }}). Governance will __evolve__ as requirements and needs change __over time__.
